# Sani Yadav — Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website built with HTML, Bootstrap, and Django (backend-ready). It showcases selected projects, links to source code, and a contact form. The site is responsive and accessible; images and scripts are included in this project for local development.

## What you'll find
- `index.html` — main landing page
- `style.css` — custom styles
- `home.js` — small client-side form handling
- `img/` — screenshots and images used on the site

## Quick start (local preview)
1. Open a terminal in the project folder (`d:\internship-saiket\task1`).
2. Start a simple HTTP server (Python required):

```powershell
python -m http.server 5500
```

3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5500`.
